![Cannes Logo](./public/logo.png)

Welcome to the frontend repository for Cannes, an e-commerce application built as part of our full stack project. This repository contains the code for the frontend user interface, providing a delightful shopping experience for our customers.

## Project Overview

Cannes is a feature-rich e-commerce app designed to cater to the needs of modern shoppers. With a sleek and intuitive interface, our application offers a wide range of products from various categories, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase items with ease. The app also incorporates essential features like user authentication, cart management, and order tracking to enhance the overall shopping journey.

The frontend repository works in tandem with the [Cannes Backend Repository](https://github.com/Sarthak-ONS/cannes-bk.git), which houses the server-side code responsible for handling data, integrating with external APIs, and managing database operations.
